## Motivation

I am a heavy Google Playbooks user. Why?

- compare to Amazon, it has much more Chinese titles
- compare to Taiwan ebook stores, it has much more English titles 😂

In short, it has the largest ebook collection for my reading languages. If I want to use just one provider to centralize my ebooks and annotations, store them online so that I can access them anytime in multiple devices(phone, tablet, laptop...) Playbook is a good choice. Not to mention the price in Playbook often a little lower then others.

After using [Zettelkasten] with [Obsidian] as my personal knowledge management system, I think its good to integrate the learning/insights from my previous reading into Obsidian. So I want to extract the annotations from Playbook. Playbook does store them on google docs though, in a format not easy to re-use 🤷‍♀️... So I decided to extract them directly from Google Takeout.
